# CLAUDE.md — FoodHub Project

Project-level instructions for Claude Code working in this repo. Inherits
from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `c:\Vishal\Projects\CLAUDE.md`; this file adds
project-specific context those don't have.

## What this is

Swiggy-style food delivery web platform (functional clone, no brand assets).
Placeholder name "FoodHub". Full design: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-food-delivery-platform-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-food-delivery-platform-design.md).
Build proceeds one phase at a time (8 phases total) — see spec §7 for the
full breakdown. Each phase gets its own brainstorm → spec-check → plan →
subagent-driven-development cycle, ends with a merge to `main`.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Realtime), **self-hosted locally via
  Docker** — no cloud/hosted Supabase project, ever (see spec §2)
- n8n for cross-actor automation (Phase 7, not wired yet)
- Google Maps JS SDK for address picking + live tracking (not wired yet —
  no API key available as of Phase 2; address picker is a manual lat/lng
  stub in the meantime, swappable later)
- React Native + Expo mobile app (customer + delivery-partner surfaces) is a
  planned follow-on sub-project after all 8 web phases ship — not started

## Local setup

See [README.md](README.md) for run instructions. Requires Docker Desktop
running before `npx supabase start`.

## Status

See [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) for phase-by-phase progress and decisions.

## Project-specific rules

- **No hosted Supabase, ever.** Local Docker stack only (Vishal's explicit
  cost/scale preference — see spec §2).
- **Cart is single-restaurant only.** Adding an item from a different
  restaurant must prompt to clear the cart, never silently mix.
- **Branding stays isolated** to `lib/branding.ts` + Tailwind `@theme`
  tokens — never hardcode the brand name/color in a component.
- **Build one phase at a time.** Don't start Phase N+1 work until Phase N is
  merged to `main`. Each phase gets its own git worktree + branch during
  execution, per `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.
- **External API keys** (Google Maps, Pexels, etc.) go in `.env.local`
  (gitignored) with a placeholder line added to `.env.example` — never
  hardcoded, never committed.
- **Images fetched from external APIs** (e.g. Pexels) are fetched once and
  the resulting URLs are hardcoded into `supabase/seed.sql` / migrations —
  not called live at runtime, to keep API keys server-side only and avoid a
  network dependency on every `db reset`.
